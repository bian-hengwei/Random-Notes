## COCOMO (COnstructive COst MOdel)

-   COCOMO 81 & COCOMO II
-   Estimate the costs
-   Estimate the phase schedule
-   Input
    -   size
    -   cost drivers
    -   constraints and priorities
-   Output
    -   effort
    -   cost
    -   schedule



## Constraints and Properties

-   Constraint
    -   Maximum schedule
    -   Maximum effort
    -   Maximum cost
-   Priority
    -   Least cost
    -   Shortest schedule
    -   Smallest number of staff



## Cost (or Productivity) Drivers

-   Additional parameters that affect productivity
    -   Product attributes
    -   Project attributes
    -   Personnel attributes
    -   Hardware attributes



## COCOMO

-   COCOMO 81
    -   Basic - size
    -   Intermediate - size + cost drivers
    -   Advanced - size + cost drivers + driver impact on each project phase
-   COCOMO II



## COCOMO 81 Basic

-   Effort $E = a (\text{KDSI})^b$
-   Duration $D = c(E)^d$
-   Recommended Staff Size $S = E / D$ 
-   KDSI - thousand delivered source instruction
-   Organic/ Semi-detached/ Embedded

 

## COCOMO 81 Intermediate

-   Effort $E = a (\text{KDSI})^b \times \text{EAF}$
-   Duration $D = c(E)^d$
-   Recommended Staff Size $S = E / D$ 
-   Uses slightly different "a" constraints
-   Adds "Effort Adjustment Factor" computed from 15 cost drivers
-   The EAF is the product of the cost drivers



## Cost Drivers

-   Personal attributes: analyst capability, application experience, programming language experience
-   Product attributes: required reliability, database size, product complexity
-   Project attributes: modern programming practices, software tools, schedule constraints
-   Hardware attributes: execution time constraints, storage constraints





## COCOMO II 1997

-   Effort $E = 2.94 \times \text{EAF} \times (\text{KSLOC})^E$
-   E is an exponent derived from the five scale drivers
    -   precedentedness
    -   development flexibility
    -   architecture/ risk resolution
    -   team cohesion
    -   process maturity
-   Duration $D = 3.67 \times (\text{Effort})^\text{SE}$
-   SE is the schedule equation component derived from the five scale drivers



## Historical Project Data

-   Best estimation model based on your own organisation's historical data



## Project Cost

-   Internal cost
    -   Labour
    -   Software and hardware
    -   Overheads
-   External cost (cost to client)
-   Profit margin



## From Effort or Duration to a Phase Schedule (Roughly)



## Schedule Compression

-   Desired schedule / initial schedule = compression factor
-   Compressed schedule effort = initial effort / compression factor
-   Extra PM needed to reduce the schedule
-   Team size = E / D



## Methods to Compress

-   Fast tracking (parallel some tasks)
-   Crashing (finish a task faster)

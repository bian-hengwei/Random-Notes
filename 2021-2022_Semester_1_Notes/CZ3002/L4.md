-   Size by Function Points
-   Adjusted FP Total
-   Converting FP to LOC
-   From Size to Effort
-   From Effort to Duration
-   From Duration to Team Size



## Objectives

-   Six steps in creating a project estimate
-   Compare between LoC and FPs
-   Calculate effort, duration, and team size using FPs



## Project Estimation

-   Effort
-   Schedule
-   Cost
-   Resource requirement



## Problems

-   Difficult to estimate
-   Based on assumptions and are hurried
-   Usually overly optimistic



## Steps

-   Estimate the **size** of the product/ system
-   Estimate the **effort** needed to create the system
-   Estimate the **duration**
-   Estimate the **manpower**
-   Estimate the **costs**
-   Estimate the **phase schedule**



## Estimating the Size

-   Line of Code (LOC) - not a very good estimate
    -   Physical/ logical lines?
    -   Include blank or comment lines?
    -   Executables only?
    -   LOC, SLOC, KLOC, KSLOC, DSI?



## Size by Function Points

-   By analogy
-   Function point - a unit of measurement to express the amount of business functionality an information system provides to a user
-   5 primary elements
    -   Inputs - application-oriented data (such as file names and menu selections)
    -   Outputs - transaction data output to user (printed reports)
    -   Inquiries - interactive inputs requiring a response (not update file)
    -   Logical files - logical master files in the system
    -   Interfaces - machine-readable interfaces to other systems
-   Function points = $\sum \text{No. of FP} \times \text{difficulty level}$



## Adjusted FP Total

-   Influence factors - that affect the complexity of the code include:
    -   Data communications, distributed processing, performance issues, design for re-use...
-   Scoring
    -   0 - No
    -   1 - Insignificant
    -   2 - Moderate
    -   3 - Average
    -   4 - Significant
    -   5 - Strong
-   Total score = sum of influences factors
-   Influence mmultipler = Total score * 0.01 + 0.65
-   Total Adjusted Function Points = (Unadjusted Total) * (Influence multiplier)



## Converting FP to LOC

-   FP * LOC per FP
-   LOC per FP
    -   C 128
    -   COBOL 105
    -   Java 53
    -   C++ 29
    -   SQL 13



## From Size to Effort

-   Conventional productivity
    -   Simple effort = size / production rate
    -   30000 SLOC / 640 SLOC per PM = 46.8 PM
    -   234 FP / 5 FP per PM = 46.8 PM
-   Benchmarks
-   Historical data



## From Effort to Duration

-   An achievable duration formula
    -   $3.0 \times (\text{Effort})^{1\over 3}$



## From Duration to Team Size (Roughly)

-   Effort / Duration

## Quality Management Activities

-   Quality assurance - aims to develop a "quality culture" where quality is seen as everyone's responsibility
-   Quality planning - involves defining appropriate quality standards and procedures and ensureing that these are followed
-   Quality control - concerned with ensuring that the required level of quality is achieved in a software product



## Software Organization

    -   Quality Assurance
    -   Project Management
        -   Engineer



## What is Quality

-   A product should meet its specification and meet the customers' needs
-   Maintainance of a desired level of quality
-   Attention to every stage of the process of delivery or production



-   Conformance to requirement - meet all user requirements
-   Fitness for use - shallow learning curve

## ISO 9000

-   A set of international standards for quality management
-   Applicable to a range of organisations from manufacturing to service industires
-   ISO 9001 applicable to organisations which design, develop, and maintain products
-   ISO 9001 is a generic model of the quality process that must be instantiated for each organisation using the standard
-   Certification

| 4 Managed    | (Quantitative) Measured process                      | Quality management, process measurement & analysis           |                             |
| 3 Defined    | (Quantitative) Process defined and institutionalized | Peer reviews, intergroup coordination, software product engineering... |                             |
| 2 Repeatable | (Intuitive) Process dependent on individuals         | Software configuration management, software quality assurance, software project tracking & oversight... |                             |
| 1 Initial    | Ad hoc/ chaotic                                      | Survival                                                     | Risky                       |



## Process-Based Quality Assurance

-   Define Processes
-   Do
    -   Developed Product
    -   Assess Product
    -   While (product is in great quality)
-   Standardise Process



## Quality Control

-   Checking the software development process to ensure that procedures and standards are being followed
-   Two approaches
    -   Quality reviews
    -   Automated software assessment and software measurement



## Performing Quality Assurance

-   Quality assurance includes all the activities related to satisfying the relevant quality standards for a project
-   Goal is continuous quality improvement
-   Benchmarking generates ideas for quality improvements by comparing specific project practices or product characteristics to those of other projects or products within or outside the performing organization
-   Quality audit is the structured review of specific quality management activities that help identify lessons learned that could improve performance on current or future projects



## Internal and External Attributes

![L2-1](images/L2-1.png)



## Software Metrics

-   Any type of measturement which relates to a software system, process or related documentation
-   Lines of code in a program
-   The number of person-days required to develop a component
-   Allow the software and software process to be quantified
-   May be used to predict product attributes or to control the software process
-   Product metrics can be used for general predictions or to identify anomalous components
-   Helps in
    -   Determine bottleneck
    -   Measure quality
    -   When to stop testing
    -   Troublesome areas
    -   Focus of resources
    -   Predict defects
-   Examples
    -   Fan in/Fan-out
    -   Length of code
    -   Cyclomatic complexity
    -   Length of identifiers
    -   Depth of conditional nesting
    -   Fog index
    -   Depth of inheritance tree
    -   Method fan-in/fan-out

    -   Conclude the results



## Quality Planning

-   Sets out the desired product qualities and how these are assessed and defines the most significant quality attributes
-   Define the quality assessment process
-   Set out which standard should be applied 



## Quality of Products

-   Defining the quality of a product
    -   Identify quality criteria

## Cost of Quality

-   Cost of conformance + cost of nonconformance
    -   Conformance: delivering products that meet requirements and fitness for use
    -   Nonconformance: taking responsibility for failures or not meeting quality expectations



## Five Cost Categories Related to Quality

-   Prevention cost - planning and executing a project withing an acceptable error range
-   Apprisal cost - evaluating processes and their outputs
-   Internal failure cost - correct an identified defect internally (Error: internal)
-   External failure cost - all errors not detected before delivery (Defect: external)
-   Measurement and test equipment cost - capital cost of equipments to perform prevention and appraisal activities

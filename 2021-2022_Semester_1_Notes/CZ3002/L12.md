## Software Maintanance Knowledge Area

-   Fundamentals
-   Key Issues
-   Techniques



## Nature of Maintenance

-   Correction
    -   Corrective
    -   Preventive
-   Enhancement
    -   Adaptive
    -   Perfective
-   Metrics
    -   Defect rate
    -   Mean time to change



## Lehman's Laws

-   Continuing change
-   Increasing complexity
-   Declining quality
-   Organisational stability



## Importance of Evolution



## Legacy System Evolution

-   Scrap the system completely
-   Continue maintaining
-   Transform with re-engineering
-   Replace with newer system



## Key Issues in Maintenance

-   Technical
    -   Limited understanding
    -   Test coverage
    -   Poor maintainability to begin with
-   Management
    -   Staffing
    -   Contractual responsibility
-   Cost
-   Measurement



## Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Components

-   Integrating COTS system
-   Faster dev
-   Lower costs



## Considerations with COTS

-   Lack of control over functionality and performance
-   Difficult to integrate
-   No control over the system evolution
-   Support from COTS vendors may stop



## System Re-Engineering

-   Rewrite a part or all of a legacy system without changing its functionality
-   Make it easier to maintain
-   Reverse Engineering
    -   Analyse software to identify components and their relationships
    -   Create abstraction
-   Forward Engineering
    -   Structure improvement
    -   Modularisation
    -   Data re-engineering
-   Cost factors
    -   Quality of the software
    -   Tool suppoft
    -   Extent of data conversion
    -   Availability of expert staff
